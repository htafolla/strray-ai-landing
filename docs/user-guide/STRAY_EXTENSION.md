## How to Use StrRay Features

### Basic Usage

1. **Framework Initialization**:

   ```bash
   bash .opencode/init.sh
   ```

2. **Mode Selection**:

   ```bash
   # Full mode (all 8 agents)
   bash .opencode/commands/mode-switch.md full

   # Lite mode (4 core agents)
   bash .opencode/commands/mode-switch.md lite
   ```

3. **Agent Interaction**:
   All StrRay agents are accessible through OpenCode's standard interface:
   ```bash
   opencode architect "Design a user authentication system"
   opencode code-reviewer "Review this React component"
   ```

### Advanced Configuration

**Custom Agent Models**:

```json
// .opencode/OpenCode.json
{
  "agents": {
    "architect": { "model": "openrouter/xai-grok-2-1212-fast-1" },
    "code-reviewer": { "model": "openrouter/xai-grok-2-1212-fast-1" }
  }
}
```

**Disabled Agents for Lite Mode**:

```json
{
  "disabled_agents": [
    "security-auditor",
    "refactorer",
    "test-architect",
    "bug-triage-specialist"
  ]
}
```

### Integration Examples

**Pre-commit Hooks**:

```bash
# Automatic code quality checks
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
# StrRay enforcer validates compliance automatically
```

**CI/CD Integration**:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: StrRay Code Quality Check
  run: bash .opencode/commands/framework-compliance-audit.md
```

## Migration from Standard OpenCode

### For Existing OpenCode Users

1. **Backup Current Configuration**:

   ```bash
   cp .opencode/OpenCode.json .opencode/OpenCode.backup.json
   ```

2. **Update to StrRay Configuration**:
   The `.opencode` directory already contains the integrated StrRay-OpenCode framework. Your existing OpenCode configuration will continue to work.

3. **Enable StrRay Features**:

   ```bash
   bash .opencode/init.sh
   ```

4. **Access Enhanced Agents**:
   ```bash
   opencode architect "Design a new feature"
   opencode code-reviewer "Review pull request"
   ```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is StrRay's relationship to OpenCode?

StrRay is implemented as a comprehensive extension within the OpenCode ecosystem. OpenCode provides the core plugin architecture and agent orchestration, while StrRay adds 8 specialized AI agents for development-focused tasks.

### Do I need to install OpenCode separately?

No. The `.opencode` directory contains the complete integrated StrRay-OpenCode framework. All OpenCode components are included and configured automatically.

### Can I use StrRay without OpenCode?

No. StrRay requires OpenCode's plugin system and orchestration capabilities to function.

### What's the difference between StrRay Lite and Full?

Both use the same OpenCode foundation but with different agent configurations:

- **Lite**: 4 core agents for essential development support
- **Full**: 8 specialized agents for comprehensive development capabilities

### How do I switch between lite and full modes?

Use the mode switching command:

```bash
bash .opencode/commands/mode-switch.md full  # All 8 agents
bash .opencode/commands/mode-switch.md lite  # 4 core agents
```

### What models does StrRay use?

All StrRay agents use `openrouter/xai-grok-2-1212-fast-1` by default, which provides excellent performance for development tasks while maintaining compatibility with OpenCode's model system.

### How do I customize agent behavior?

Modify the agents configuration in `.opencode/OpenCode.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "architect": { "model": "openrouter/xai-grok-2-1212-fast-1" },
    "code-reviewer": { "model": "openrouter/xai-grok-2-1212-fast-1" }
  }
}
```

### What if I encounter issues with StrRay?

1. Check framework initialization: `bash .opencode/init.sh`
2. Verify mode settings: `jq '.disabled_agents' .opencode/OpenCode.json`
3. Review logs: `logs/agents/refactoring-log.md`
4. Check compliance: `bash .opencode/commands/framework-compliance-audit.md`
