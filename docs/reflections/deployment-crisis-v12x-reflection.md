# StringRay Deployment Reflection Document
## v1.2.x Release Post-Mortem & Lessons Learned

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Author:** StringRay Development Team  
**Version:** v1.2.7 (Working Release)  
**Status:** Production Ready

---

## Executive Summary

The v1.2.x release cycle revealed critical gaps in our deployment validation process. Despite having a robust testing framework, our deployment pipeline lacked sufficient end-to-end verification of the npm package consumer experience. This reflection documents what went wrong, what we fixed, and what must be implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.

---

## Part 1: What Went Wrong - The Root Causes

### 1.1 Missing Path Transformation Bug
**Issue:** MCP server paths in `opencode.json` were not being transformed from development paths to consumer paths.

**Root Cause:** 
- Source `opencode.json` uses: `"./dist/mcps/orchestrator.server.js"`
- Postinstall script looked for: `"./dist/plugin/mcps/"` (with "plugin" subdirectory)
- **Pattern mismatch** - the regex didn't match the actual source paths

**Impact:**
- Consumers installing via npm got broken MCP server configurations
- MCP servers couldn't start because paths pointed to non-existent files
- CLI commands worked, but agent orchestration failed

**Why We Missed It:**
- Local testing always ran from dev environment where paths work
- No automated test simulated the consumer npm install experience
- The `npx strray-ai install` command was tested in dev directory, not isolated temp directory

### 1.2 Incorrect Path Assumption
**Issue:** Postinstall script added "plugin" to MCP paths when it shouldn't.

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect assumption that MCP servers were in `dist/plugin/mcps/`
- Actually located in `dist/mcps/` (no "plugin" subdirectory)
- This was a design documentation gap

**Impact:**
- All MCP server paths were broken in consumer installations
- 15 MCP servers couldn't start
- Framework appeared to install but core functionality failed

### 1.3 CLI Version Mismatch
**Issue:** CLI reported v1.1.0 when package was v1.2.x

**Root Cause:**
- `src/cli/index.ts` had hardcoded version `"1.1.0"`
- No automated sync between package.json and CLI version
- Manual update was forgotten during version bumps

**Impact:**
- Users confused about which version was installed
- Version verification tests failed
- Lost confidence in package integrity

### 1.4 Missing Scripts Directory
**Issue:** `scripts/mjs/` directory not included in npm package.

**Root Cause:**
- Only `scripts/node/` was in package.json files array
- `scripts/mjs/` tests and utilities were missing
- Consumers couldn't run validation scripts

**Impact:**
- Couldn't validate installation in consumer environment
- Test scripts referenced in documentation were unavailable
- No way for consumers to self-diagnose issues

### 1.5 Missing .opencode/package.json
**Issue:** npm pack excluded package.json from subdirectories.

**Root Cause:**
- npm automatically excludes package.json files in subdirectories
- Required explicit inclusion in files array
- Postinstall validation script expected this file

**Impact:**
- Validation script reported failures
- Some tools expected this metadata file

### 1.6 Case Sensitivity Issues
**Issue:** Validator checks for "sisyphus" but config had "Sisyphus".

**Root Cause:**
- Inconsistent casing between validator and config file
- JavaScript includes() is case-sensitive
- No normalization of agent names

**Impact:**
- Validation false negatives
- Reported "sisyphus not disabled" when it was

### 1.7 Self-Reference in Dependencies
**Issue:** package.json had `"strray-ai": "file:strray-ai-1.2.2.tgz"` in dependencies.

**Root Cause:**
- Likely added during development/testing and not removed
- Caused npm install to fail with missing file errors

**Impact:**
- npm install failures for consumers
- Circular dependency issues

---

## Part 2: What We Fixed - The Solutions

### 2.1 Fixed MCP Path Transformation
**Fix:** Updated postinstall.cjs to use correct regex patterns:

```javascript
// Before (broken):
opencodeContent = opencodeContent.replace(
  /"\.\.?\/dist\/plugin\/mcps\//g,
  '"node_modules/strray-ai/dist/plugin/mcps/'
);

// After (fixed):
opencodeContent = opencodeContent.replace(
  /"\.\.?\/dist\/mcps\//g,
  '"node_modules/strray-ai/dist/mcps/'
);
```

**Lesson:** Source files must be audited to ensure regex patterns match actual content.

### 2.2 Added Missing Directories to Package
**Fix:** Updated package.json files array:

```json
"files": [
  "dist/",
  "scripts/node/",
  "scripts/mjs/",  // Added
  ".opencode/",
  ".opencode/package.json",  // Added explicitly
  ".strray/",
  "opencode.json",
  "README.md",
  "LICENSE"
]
```

**Lesson:** Must verify all required files are included in the npm package.

### 2.3 Fixed Case Sensitivity
**Fix:** Made validation case-insensitive:

```javascript
// Before:
config.disabled_agents.includes("sisyphus")

// After:
config.disabled_agents.some(agent => agent.toLowerCase() === "sisyphus")
```

**Lesson:** User-facing identifiers should be normalized to lowercase for comparison.

### 2.4 Updated CLI Version
**Fix:** Synced CLI version with package version and added to universal version manager.

```typescript
// src/cli/index.ts
.version("1.6.0");

// scripts/node/universal-version-manager.js
const UPDATE_PATTERNS = [
  {
    pattern: /\.version\("[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"\)/g,
    replacement: `.version("${OFFICIAL_VERSIONS.framework.version}")`
  }
];
```

**Lesson:** All version references must be managed centrally and updated atomically.

### 2.5 Created CI/CD Path Verification
**Fix:** Added comprehensive CI test script:

- `scripts/bash/ci-npm-orchestration-test.sh`
- Tests full npm pack → install → verify workflow
- Runs in isolated temp directory
- Validates all paths are transformed correctly

**Lesson:** Must test the full consumer experience, not just dev environment.

### 2.6 Fixed Validator Plugin Check
**Fix:** Made plugin detection more robust:

```javascript
// Before:
p.includes("stringray")

// After:
p.toLowerCase().includes("strray")
```

**Lesson:** Match actual package name (strray) not assumed name (stringray).

### 2.7 Removed Self-Reference
**Fix:** Removed circular dependency from package.json.

**Lesson:** Never commit test dependencies to production package.json.

## Part 3: What We Learned - Key Insights

### 3.1 The Dev Environment Trap
**Problem:** Everything works in development, but breaks in production.

**Insight:** 
- Development paths differ from consumer paths
- File structure in dev (TypeScript source) differs from dist (compiled JS)
- Must test from a clean, isolated environment

**Solution:** 
- Always test `npm install` in a temp directory
- Never assume dev environment == consumer environment

### 3.2 npm Pack Surprises
**Problem:** npm pack behavior is not always intuitive.

**Insights:**
- npm excludes certain files by default (package.json in subdirs)
- Files array must be explicit
- Must verify actual tarball contents with `npm pack --dry-run`

**Solution:**
- Create a tarball verification step
- List all expected files and verify they're present

### 3.3 Regex Pattern Fragility
**Problem:** Regex patterns for path transformation were fragile.

**Insights:**
- Small changes in source files break transformation
- No validation that patterns actually match anything
- Silent failures (paths don't transform, no error)

**Solution:**
- Add validation that transformations occurred
- Count replacements and fail if zero
- Use more robust parsing (AST) instead of regex where possible

### 3.4 Version Management Complexity
**Problem:** Multiple files need version updates.

**Insights:**
- package.json, CLI, README, docs, CHANGELOG all need updates
- Manual updates are error-prone
- Universal version manager is essential

**Solution:**
- Centralize all version strings
- Automate version propagation
- Single command to bump all versions

### 3.5 Testing Gaps
**Problem:** Unit tests passed but deployment failed.

**Insights:**
- Unit tests test code logic, not deployment artifacts
- Integration tests test components, not full user experience
- Need "deployment acceptance tests"

**Solution:**
- Add deployment-specific test suite
- Test the actual npm package, not source code
- Verify postinstall script works in isolation

## Part 4: What's Still Missing - Future Improvements

### 4.1 Pre-Publish Validation Hook
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

**Requirement:** Before `npm publish`, automatically:
1. Build the package
2. Create tarball
3. Install in temp directory
4. Run all validation scripts
5. Verify MCP servers start
6. Only proceed if all tests pass

**Implementation:**
```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "prepublishOnly": "npm run build && npm run validate:deployment"
}
```

### 4.2 Automated Version Sync
**Status:** Partially Implemented  
**Priority:** HIGH

**Requirement:** Single source of truth for all version references.

**Gaps:**
- CLI version still requires manual update
- Some documentation versions not managed
- Need automated validation that all versions match

**Implementation:**
- Enhance universal-version-manager.js
- Add pre-commit hook to check version consistency
- Fail CI if versions don't match

### 4.3 Deployment Smoke Tests
**Status:** Partially Implemented  
**Priority:** HIGH

**Current:** `ci-npm-orchestration-test.sh` exists but:
- Not integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Doesn't run automatically
- Needs better reporting

**Improvement:**
- Run on every PR
- Generate detailed report
- Block merge if deployment tests fail
- Upload artifacts for inspection

### 4.4 Path Transformation Validation
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Priority:** HIGH

**Requirement:** Verify that all paths are transformed correctly.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// In postinstall.cjs
const originalContent = fs.readFileSync(opencodePath, "utf8");
let modifiedContent = originalContent;
// ... transformations ...
const replacements = countReplacements(originalContent, modifiedContent);
if (replacements === 0) {
  console.error("❌ No path transformations occurred!");
  process.exit(1);
}
```

### 4.5 Package Content Verification
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Requirement:** Verify all required files are in the tarball.

**Implementation:**
```bash
# After npm pack
required_files=(
  "package/dist/plugin/strray-codex-injection.js"
  "package/dist/mcps/orchestrator.server.js"
  "package/scripts/mjs/"
  "package/.opencode/package.json"
)
for file in "${required_files[@]}"; do
  if ! tar -tzf strray-ai-*.tgz | grep -q "$file"; then
    echo "❌ Missing: $file"
    exit 1
  fi
done
```

### 4.6 MCP Server Health Check
**Status:** Partially Implemented  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Current:** `validate-mcp-connectivity.js` exists

**Gaps:**
- Not run automatically after install
- Doesn't verify all 15 servers
- No health check endpoint

**Improvement:**
- Run as part of postinstall
- Verify each server can start and respond
- Report which servers are functional

### 4.7 Automated Rollback Capability
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Requirement:** If deployment fails, automatically unpublish broken version.

**Implementation:**
```bash
# After npm publish
if ! npm run test:consumer; then
  npm unpublish strray-ai@$VERSION
  echo "❌ Unpublished broken version $VERSION"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 4.8 Consumer Feedback Loop
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Priority:** LOW

**Requirement:** Track deployment success/failure in real installations.

**Ideas:**
- Optional telemetry in postinstall (opt-in)
- GitHub issues template for deployment problems
- Dashboard showing version adoption

### 4.9 Documentation Synchronization
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Priority:** LOW

**Requirement:** All documentation must match deployed version.

**Gaps:**
- README.md examples may be outdated
- CHANGELOG may not reflect actual changes
- API documentation may drift

**Implementation:**
- Auto-generate README examples from tests
- Link CHANGELOG to git commits
- Version all documentation

## Part 6: The Golden Rules

### For Future Releases

1. **NEVER publish without testing the actual tarball**
   - `npm pack` → install in temp dir → run tests → publish

2. **ALWAYS verify path transformations**
   - Count replacements
   - Verify transformed paths exist
   - Test in isolation

3. **SYNC all versions centrally**
   - One source of truth
   - Automated propagation
   - Validation before commit

4. **TEST the consumer experience, not dev experience**
   - Clean temp directory
   - No dev dependencies
   - Fresh npm install

5. **VALIDATE package contents**
   - All required files present
   - No unexpected files
   - Correct structure

6. **BLOCK on deployment test failures**
   - CI must pass deployment tests
   - No exceptions
   - Fix before merging

## Conclusion

The v1.2.x deployment issues were painful but educational. The root cause was a gap between "works in dev" and "works for consumers". We've fixed all immediate issues and v1.2.7 is production-ready.

The key lesson: **deployment is a first-class concern, not an afterthought.** Every release must be validated as if we were a consumer installing for the first time.

With the improvements outlined in this document, future deployments will be bulletproof. The automation and validation will catch issues before they reach users.

**Status: v1.2.7 is stable and production-ready.**
