### 8 Specialized AI Agents

All agents operate in `subagent` mode with full tool access and automatic delegation:

1. **enforcer** - Codex compliance & error prevention
2. **architect** - System design & technical decisions
3. **orchestrator** - Multi-agent workflow coordination
4. **bug-triage-specialist** - Error investigation & surgical fixes
5. **code-reviewer** - Quality assessment & standards validation
6. **security-auditor** - Vulnerability detection & compliance
7. **refactorer** - Technical debt elimination & code consolidation
8. **test-architect** - Testing strategy & coverage optimization

### OpenCode Plugin Integration

**StrRay operates as a comprehensive plugin within the OpenCode ecosystem**, providing systematic error prevention through integrated agent orchestration and codex compliance enforcement.

#### Plugin Architecture

- **Plugin Entry Point**: `plugin/strray-codex-injection.ts` serves as the main plugin interface
- **Configuration Integration**: `.opencode/OpenCode.json` contains StrRay-specific configuration blocks
- **Hook System**: Implements OpenCode's hook system for tool execution interception and system prompt injection

#### OpenCode Integration Points

- **Hook Integration**: `agent.start`, `tool.execute.before`, `tool.execute.after` hooks
- **MCP Servers**: 9 MCP servers (7 agent-specific + 2 knowledge skills)
- **Model Routing**: All 8 agents configured to use `openrouter/xai-grok-2-1212-fast-1` model
- **Session Management**: Cross-plugin session persistence and state sharing

#### Python Backend Integration

- **Hybrid Architecture**: TypeScript frontend + Python backend for advanced capabilities
- **Core Components**: Located in `src/core/` with TypeScript implementation
- **Cross-Language Communication**: JSON-RPC/WebSocket protocols for inter-process communication
- **State Synchronization**: Shared state management between TypeScript and Python layers

### Intelligent Delegation System

**Complexity Analysis Engine** automatically routes tasks based on 6 metrics:

```typescript
interface ComplexityMetrics {
  fileCount: number; // Files affected
  changeVolume: number; // Lines changed (0-25 points)
  operationType:
    | "create"
    | "modify"
    | "refactor"
    | "analyze"
    | "debug"
    | "test";
  dependencies: number; // Component dependencies (0-15 points)
  riskLevel: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical";
  estimatedDuration: number; // Minutes (0-15 points)
}
```

**Decision Matrix:**

- **Score ≤ 25**: Single-agent execution (1 agent)
- **Score ≤ 50**: Single-agent execution (1 agent)
- **Score ≤ 95**: Multi-agent orchestration (2+ agents)
- **Score > 95**: Orchestrator-led enterprise workflow (3+ agents)

## 📚 Universal Development Codex v1.1.1

**Purpose**: Systematic error prevention and production-ready development framework

The codex defines 45 mandatory terms that guide AI-assisted development under the StrRay Framework. Every agent loads this codex during initialization and validates all actions against these terms to achieve 99.6% error prevention.

## Critical Codex Terms for Enforcement

### Core Terms (1-10)

#### 1. Progressive Prod-Ready Code

All code must be production-ready from the first commit. No placeholder, stub, or incomplete implementations. Every function, class, and module must be fully functional and ready for deployment.

#### 2. No Patches/Boiler/Stubs/Bridge Code

Prohibit:

- Temporary patches that are "meant to be fixed later"
- Boilerplate code that serves no real purpose
- Stub implementations that don't function
- Bridge code that creates unnecessary abstractions

All code must have clear, permanent purpose and complete implementation.

#### 3. Do Not Over-Engineer the Solution

Solutions should be:

- Simple and direct
- Focused on the actual problem
- Free of unnecessary abstractions
- Maintainable and understandable
- Minimal complexity for the required functionality

#### 4. Fit for Purpose and Prod-Level Code

Every piece of code must:

- Solve the specific problem it was created for
- Meet production standards (error handling, logging, monitoring)
- Be maintainable by other developers
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Include appropriate tests

#### 5. Surgical Fixes Where Needed

Apply precise, targeted fixes:

- Fix the root cause, not symptoms
- Make minimal changes to resolve the issue
- Avoid refactoring unrelated code
- Preserve existing functionality
- Document the fix clearly

#### 6. Batched Introspection Cycles

Group introspection and analysis into intentional cycles:

## 🤖 Agent Operational Context

### Agent Architecture & Capabilities

**All StrRay agents operate in `subagent` mode** with comprehensive tool access and automatic delegation based on complexity analysis. Agents are defined as configuration objects, not classes, enabling dynamic loading and hot-swapping.

---

## 🔬 Complexity Analysis System

### Metrics-Based Task Routing

The **ComplexityAnalyzer** automatically evaluates every operation using 6 key metrics:

```typescript
interface ComplexityMetrics {
  fileCount: number; // Files affected (0-20 points)
  changeVolume: number; // Lines changed (0-25 points)
  operationType: OperationType; // create|modify|refactor|analyze|debug|test (multiplier)
  dependencies: number; // Component dependencies (0-15 points)
  riskLevel: RiskLevel; // low|medium|high|critical (multiplier)
  estimatedDuration: number; // Minutes (0-15 points)
}
```

### Complexity Scoring Algorithm

**Total Score Calculation:**

```typescript
score = 0;
score += Math.min(fileCount * 2, 20); // File impact
score += Math.min(changeVolume / 10, 25); // Change volume
score *= operationWeights[operationType]; // Operation multiplier
score += Math.min(dependencies * 3, 15); // Dependencies
score *= riskMultipliers[riskLevel]; // Risk multiplier
score += Math.min(estimatedDuration / 10, 15); // Duration impact

  debug: 2.0,       // Highest complexity (investigation required)
  test: 1.3         // Testing complexity
}
```

### Risk Multipliers

```typescript
{
  low: 0.8,         // Reduce complexity
  medium: 1.0,      // No change
  high: 1.3,        // Increase complexity
  critical: 1.6     // Major increase
}
```
