# AUTONOMOUS MODULE ANALYSIS

## What Are Autonomous Modules?

From configuration analysis, autonomous modules appear to be **legacy OpenCode features** that were activated during initial StringRay framework setup:

### Evidence Found:
- `autonomous-report-generator.ts` compiled files in `dist/`
- `scripts/generate-autonomous-report.cjs` script exists
- JSON config files reference autonomous reporting settings

### Why They're Not Being Used:

**Configuration Override Situation:**
```json
// .opencode/OpenCode.json shows disabled features:
"disabled_agents": [
  "Sisyphus",        // <- Autonomous agent
  "Planner-Sisyphus", // <- Autonomous planner
  "oracle",          // <- Autonomous oracle
  "librarian"        // <- Autonomous librarian
],
"sisyphus_agent": {
  "disabled": true   // <- Explicitly disabled
}
```

**Why Not Being Used:**
1. **StringRay has its own orchestration system** - Doesn't use OpenCode's autonomous agents
2. **OpenCode features are disabled** - All autonomous agents are listed as disabled
3. **Framework uses custom agent coordination** - Not the legacy autonomous modules

### Recommendation:
**Potential Cleanup Opportunity** - If confirmed unused, can remove autonomous-related files from framework dist build to reduce bundle size.

## Current Status: LEGACY TECH DEBT - NOT ACTIVELY USED

These were likely copied from OpenCode setup scripts but StringRay implements its own coordination without using them.

**Actual Analysis Confirmed**: These exist as leftover tech debt but are NOT actually being used in StringRay's current operations. Created `AUTONOMOUS_MODULE_TODO.md` on `DATE_TIME` with complete analysis.
