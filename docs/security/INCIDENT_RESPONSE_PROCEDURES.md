# Incident Response Procedures - StrRay Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents in StrRay Framework projects. It provides a structured approach to incident detection, assessment, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (P0) - Immediate Response Required

- **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data (PII, financial, health)
- **System Compromise**: Complete system takeover or root access gained
- **Service Disruption**: Widespread outage affecting all users
- **Active Exploitation**: Real-time attack in progress

#### High (P1) - Response within 1 hour

- **Unauthorized Access**: Single user account compromise with elevated privileges
- **Malware Infection**: Malicious code detected on systems
- **Data Exposure**: Sensitive data accessible without authorization
- **Denial of Service**: Targeted attack impacting service availability

#### Medium (P2) - Response within 4 hours

- **Suspicious Activity**: Unusual patterns that may indicate compromise
- **Configuration Error**: Security misconfiguration exposing data
- **Failed Attack**: Attempted exploit that was blocked
- **Policy Violation**: Internal security policy breach

#### Low (P3) - Response within 24 hours

- **Probing**: Port scanning or vulnerability testing
- **Minor Exposure**: Non-sensitive data exposure
- **False Positive**: Security alert that proves benign

## Incident Response Team

### Core Response Team

- **Incident Response Coordinator**: Overall coordination and communication
- **Security Lead**: Technical security assessment and containment
- **Engineering Lead**: System access and technical fixes
- **Legal/Compliance**: Regulatory requirements and notifications
- **Communications Lead**: Internal/external communications

### Extended Team (As Needed)

- **DevOps/SRE**: Infrastructure access and monitoring
- **Database Administrators**: Data recovery and forensics
- **External Experts**: Specialized security consultants
- **Law Enforcement Liaison**: For criminal investigations

## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection & Assessment (0-15 minutes)

#### 1.1 Incident Detection

**Automated Detection:**

- StrRay SecurityAuditor alerts
- Framework monitoring dashboards
- Log analysis and anomaly detection
- User reports and system alerts

**Manual Detection:**

- Security code reviews
- Penetration testing results
- Compliance audits
- Internal security monitoring

#### 1.2 Initial Assessment

**Gather Information:**

```bash
# Collect initial evidence
date
whoami
hostname
uptime
ps aux | grep -E "(strray|node|npm)" | head -20
netstat -tlnp | grep -E ":(3000|443|80)"
```

**Assess Impact:**

- What systems/data are affected?
- How many users impacted?
- What is the potential damage?
- Is the incident ongoing?

#### 1.3 Classification & Notification

**Immediate Actions:**

- [ ] Assign incident severity level
- [ ] Notify incident response team
- [ ] Start incident response log
- [ ] Preserve evidence (don't modify affected systems)

**Notification Template:**

```
INCIDENT ALERT - [SEVERITY LEVEL]

Incident ID: IR-[YYYY]-[NNN]
Detected: [TIMESTAMP]
Reported By: [NAME/DETECTION METHOD]
Severity: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

Brief Description:
[Affected systems, potential impact, current status]

Next Steps:
[Immediate containment actions planned]

Response Team:
[Assigned team members and roles]
```

### Phase 2: Containment (15-60 minutes)

#### 2.1 Short-term Containment

**Isolate Affected Systems:**

```bash
# Disconnect compromised systems from network
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s [COMPROMISED_IP] -j DROP
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d [COMPROMISED_IP] -j DROP

# Stop affected services
sudo systemctl stop strray-framework
sudo systemctl stop nginx

# Backup evidence before shutdown
sudo mkdir -p /var/forensics/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
sudo cp -r /var/log/strray/ /var/forensics/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/
```

**Access Control:**

- Revoke compromised credentials
- Implement emergency access controls
- Disable affected user accounts
- Update firewall rules

#### 2.2 Evidence Preservation

**Framework-Specific Evidence:**

```bash
# Preserve StrRay session data
sudo cp -r /opt/strray/sessions/ /var/forensics/sessions/
sudo cp /opt/strray/config/security.json /var/forensics/

# Collect audit logs
sudo journalctl --since "1 hour ago" -u strray-framework > /var/forensics/system_logs.txt
sudo cp /var/log/strray/security-audit.log /var/forensics/

# Preserve plugin execution data
sudo cp -r /opt/strray/plugins/active/ /var/forensics/plugins/
```

**Chain of Custody:**

- Document who collected what evidence
- Timestamp all evidence collection
- Use write-once media for evidence storage
- Maintain detailed collection logs

### Phase 3: Eradication (1-4 hours)

#### 3.1 Root Cause Analysis

**Technical Investigation:**

- Analyze attack vectors and methods
- Identify exploited vulnerabilities
- Determine attacker access level and duration
- Map complete compromise scope

**Framework-Specific Analysis:**

```bash
# Run comprehensive security audit
cd /opt/strray
npm run security-audit > /var/forensics/post_incident_audit.txt

# Analyze plugin security
node scripts/analyze-plugin-security.js > /var/forensics/plugin_analysis.txt

# Check for backdoors and persistence mechanisms
sudo find /opt/strray -name "*.sh" -exec grep -l "nc\|netcat\|bash -i" {} \;
sudo find /opt/strray -name "*.js" -exec grep -l "eval\|Function\|child_process" {} \;
```

#### 3.2 Vulnerability Remediation

**Immediate Fixes:**

- Apply security patches
- Update vulnerable dependencies
- Reconfigure security settings
- Implement additional controls

**Framework Updates:**

```bash
# Update StrRay Framework
cd /opt/strray
npm audit fix
npm update strray-framework

# Reconfigure security settings
nano config/security.json
# Enable additional security hardening

# Update security headers
nano config/security-headers.json
# Add incident-specific protections
```

#### 3.3 System Cleanup

**Remove Malicious Code:**

```bash
# Remove identified malware
sudo rm -f /tmp/malicious_file
sudo find /opt/strray -name "*backdoor*" -delete

# Clean system of persistence mechanisms
sudo crontab -l | grep -v malicious_command | crontab -
sudo find /etc/rc.local -name "*malicious*" -delete

# Reset compromised passwords
sudo passwd compromised_user
# Force password change on next login
sudo chage -d 0 compromised_user
```

### Phase 4: Recovery (4-24 hours)

#### 4.1 System Restoration

**Gradual Recovery:**

- Restore from clean backups
- Verify system integrity before reconnection
- Monitor for re-compromise during recovery

**Framework Recovery:**

```bash
# Restore from clean backup
sudo systemctl stop strray-framework
sudo rsync -av --delete /backup/strray-clean/ /opt/strray/
sudo chown -R strray:strray /opt/strray

# Verify framework integrity
cd /opt/strray
npm run security-audit
npm test

# Gradual service restoration
sudo systemctl start strray-framework
# Monitor for 30 minutes before full restoration
```

#### 4.2 Validation Testing

**Security Testing:**

```bash
# Run comprehensive security tests
npm run security-test-suite

# Validate security controls
curl -I https://your-app.com | grep -E "(Content-Security|Strict-Transport|X-Frame)"

# Test authentication flows
npm run test:auth

# Verify data integrity
npm run test:data-integrity
```

#### 4.3 Monitoring Implementation

**Enhanced Monitoring:**

```bash
# Enable additional logging
nano config/monitoring.json
# Add incident-specific alerts

# Configure alerting
nano config/alerts.json
# Set up real-time notifications

# Implement behavioral monitoring
npm run setup-behavioral-monitoring
```
